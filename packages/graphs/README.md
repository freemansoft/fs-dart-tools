# Graph implementations

Graphs implemented in a way that works for <https://pub.dev/packages/graphs> hosted on [dart-lang-tools on GitHub](https://github.com/dart-lang/tools/tree/main/pkgs/graphs)

## Graph Implementations

...for some definition of "implemented"

* [Adjacency Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix)
* [Adjacency List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list)
* [Edge List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_list)

## Possible future graph implmenetations

* [Incidence Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_matrix)

## Features

## Additional information

### General graph references

* [Graph discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics))
* [Directed Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph)

### Dart references on algorithms

* [Data Structures and Algorithms 5/5 by Al-Shahmeh](https://medium.com/@m.m.shahmeh/data-structures-algorithms-in-dart-5-5-660e0ef30a4d)

### Algorithms I wish the Dart team would implement

* [Stoer Wagner algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoer%E2%80%93Wagner_algorithm)
